# Rapid Corruption

## Description

This game developed in a one-week game jam! You play a rabbit whose environment is 
polluted by garbage. With all your strength you collect the garbage and bring it to
the tents, so that people become aware. Incidentally, you follow the little cute 
rabbits that you should protect from the garbage, otherwise the offspring would be 
endangered.

## Control

You move the rabbit with 'WASD' and look with 'Mouse'. 'Left mouse button', you 
call the baby rabbits, and with 'Right mouse button' they stopped. You can sprint 
with 'Shift'. The button 'F' enabled the head-up-display and with 'P' paused the 
game and show the controls.
