# Rapid Corruption

## Description

You play a rabbit whose environment is polluted by garbage. With all your strength you collect the garbage and bring it to the tents, 
so that people become aware. Incidentally, you follow the little cute rabbits that you should protect from the garbage, 
otherwise the offspring would be endangered.

## Control

You move the rabbit with 'WASD' and look with 'Mouse'. 'Left mouse button', you call the baby rabbits, and with 'Right mouse button' they stopped. 
You can sprint with 'Shift'.
